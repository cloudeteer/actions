# Set environment variables

This GitHub Action allows you to extract the `required_version` of Terraform specified in your configuration and use it as an output within your GitHub Actions workflow. This is useful for ensuring that workflows adhere to the same Terraform version specified in the project configuration.

## How It Works

1. This action reads each file in a directory for the `required_version` directive.
2. It extracts the version and sets it as an output.
3. You can then use this output in other steps within your workflow.

## Use Cases

- **Version validation**: Ensure that all actions use the exact same Terraform version as defined in your projectâ€™s configuration.
- **Consistency checks**: Automate version checks for consistency across multiple repositories.
- **Terraform setup**: Use the extracted version to dynamically set up the correct version of Terraform for the workflow execution.
